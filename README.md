# Pictomage

A top-down 2D puzzle-shooter game. Made in 1 week for the [Raylib 5K gamejam](https://itch.io/jam/raylib-5k-gamejam). Play it from your browser on [itch.io](https://blatnik.itch.io/pictomage), or download a native binary from the [Releases](https://github.com/blat-blatnik/Pictomage/releases) page.

## System requirements

- WASM capable web browser (for the browser version).
- 1 GHz CPU.
- 256 MB of RAM.
- OpenGL 3.3 / DirectX 10 capable GPU.

## How to build (Web)

This all assumes you are using Windows 10. You will need the Emscripten SDK:

1. Go to the [emsdk github page](https://github.com/emscripten-core/emsdk).
2. Click on the green `Code` dropdown and then `Download ZIP`.
3. Extract the zip to a folder called `Emscripten`, and put that folder wherever you want.
4. In the start menu search bar, search for `path`. Then click on `Edit the system environment variables`.
5. In the `System variables` list, find the `Path` variable, select it, then click `Edit`.
6. Press `New`, and type out the path to the `Emscripten` folder (e.g. `C:\dev\Emscripten`).
7. Press `Ok` to close all the open windows.
8. To make sure everything worked, open up a new command prompt, and run `emsdk`. It should say `Missing command; Type 'emsdk help'..`
8. In the same command prompt, run `emsdk update` followed by `emsdk install latest`. 
9. You can now just run [`webbuild.bat`](./webbuild.bat) inside this project to build the game. The output goes into [`bin/web/`](./bin/web/).
10. Run [`webrun.bat`](./webrun.bat) to run the game in your browser.

## How to build (Windows - Visual Studio)

1. You need to download and install [Visual Studio 2022](https://visualstudio.microsoft.com/vs/).
2. When you need to select which components to install, make sure `Desktop development with C++` is ticked.
3. Open up [`Pictomage.sln`](./Pictomage.sln) in Visual Studio and click the run button at the top. The output goes into [`bin/windows/`](./bin/windows/)

## How to build (Mac)

Open a terminal at the root of the project, and compile the code with clang:

```bash
$ clang -framework CoreVideo -framework IOKit -framework Cocoa -framework GLUT -framework OpenGL src/*.c -L./lib -lraylib_mac_x64 -o Pictomage -target x86_64-apple-macos10.12
```

This will produce an x64 executable, `Pictomage`, that you can run. If you want to compile for arm64 (Apple M1), run the following instead:

```bash
$ clang -framework CoreVideo -framework IOKit -framework Cocoa -framework GLUT -framework OpenGL src/*.c -L./lib -lraylib_mac_arm64 -o Pictomage -target arm64-apple-macos11
```

The [`macbuild.sh`](./macbuild.sh) script will compile the code for both targets, package it into a universal binary, make an app bundle, as well as a DMG installer. Run it like this:

```bash
$ chmod +x macbuild.sh
$ ./macbuild.sh
```

The output will be in [`bin/mac/`](./bin/mac).
